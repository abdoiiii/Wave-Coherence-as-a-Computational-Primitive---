abstract: >-
  A validated mathematical framework using phase encoding on the unit circle
  and harmonic coherence as a universal relationship detection operator.
  A single function — cos(n * (θ_a - θ_b)) — detects exact matches,
  harmonic families, oppositions, fuzzy proximity, and multi-type
  relationships. Validated across 10 structured tests with reproducible
  Rust code. Key result: harmonic scan discovers multi-group relationships
  that require multiple SQL JOINs, with infinite harmonic capacity and
  geometric invariants that persist across all frequencies.
