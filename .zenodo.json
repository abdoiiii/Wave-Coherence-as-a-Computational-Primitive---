    "title": "Wave Coherence as a Computational Primitive: Phase-Encoded Relationship Detection via Harmonic Analysis",
    "description": "A validated mathematical framework using phase encoding on the unit circle and harmonic coherence (cos(n * delta)) as a universal relationship detection operator. Includes a geometric relationship catalog derived from cross-civilizational analysis of circular division systems, a stripped mathematical specification, a 10-test validation suite in Rust, and a formal validation paper. All 10 tests pass, confirming correctness, expressiveness, and composability of the approach. Key result: a single harmonic scan discovers multi-group relationships that require multiple SQL JOINs, with infinite harmonic capacity and geometric invariants that persist across all frequencies. Potential applications include database query engines, LLM attention architectures, and typed knowledge retrieval.",
